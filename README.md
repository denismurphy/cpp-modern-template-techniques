# C++ Modern Template Techniques

Here i explore the use of advanced template techniques in C++, including class template argument deduction, smart pointers, structs, classes, abstract classes, virtual functions, `auto`, `lambda`, and `constexpr`.

The goal of this repository is for me to learn about modern template techniques in C++ and to serve as a resource ot other C++ developers looking to improve their template programming skills.

## Contents

The repo contains various examples that illustrate different advanced template techniques and their use cases. Each example is well commented and easy to understand.

### Class Template Argument Deduction

Learn how to use C++17's class template argument deduction feature to deduce template arguments from constructor parameters.

### Smart Pointers

Discover how to use smart pointers to manage the lifetime of objects in class templates and structs.

### Structs and Classes

Explore the use of structs and classes in template programming and how they can be used together.

### Abstract Classes and Virtual Functions

Discover the powerful combination of abstract classes and virtual functions in template programming.

### Auto and Lambda

See how `auto` and lambda can be used in conjunction with templates to make code more concise and expressive.

### Constexpr

Learn how to use `constexpr` to make template code more efficient at runtime and during compile-time.

## How to Use

The examples in this repository are meant to be studied and used as reference, with each example covering a specific concept.

It is recommended that you have a basic understanding of template programming in C++ before diving into the examples.

Each example has a main function, which can be run to see the output of the code.
